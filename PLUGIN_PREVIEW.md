Set savings targets and track your progress. Allocate percentages or fixed amounts from your accounts toward each goal.

## How it works

Create a goal for anything you're saving toward - a vacation, emergency fund, house down payment, new car. Link your accounts and specify how much of each account counts toward the goal (a percentage or fixed amount). The plugin tracks your progress automatically.

## What you'll see

- **Progress toward each goal** - Visual indicator showing how close you are
- **Target amounts and dates** - Optional deadlines with projected completion
- **Account allocations** - Flexible linking with percentages or fixed amounts
- **On-track status** - Whether your current savings rate will hit your target

## Getting started

Create your first goal from the plugin's sidebar view. Give it a name, target amount, and optionally a target date. Then link one or more accounts and specify how much of each counts toward this goal.
